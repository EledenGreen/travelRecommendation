   First install the required libraries:   
     run: `npm install`   
   Then to start a local server:   
     run: `npm run start`   
   Now the website should be available on like:   
     `http://192.168.137.1:8080`  
      `http://192.168.69.189:8080`  
      `http://127.0.0.1:8080`  
2. If running on remote server, no need for `npm install`
